# Feature Detection
-----------------------
## FAST
--------
**Introduction**
* __FAST__ which means _"Features from accelerated segment test"_, is first corner detect algorithm based on the **AST** to find a set of key points in the image. 
* The main idea of the algorithm is to evaluating the pixels in a Bresenham circle of radius _r_ around the candidate point.
* If _n_ contiguous pixels are all brighter than the nucleus by at least _t_ or all darker than the nucleus by _t_, then the pixel under the nucleus is considered to be a feature.

**Algorithm**

* A feature is detected at *p* if the intensities of at least *N* contiguous pixels are all above the intensity of candidate pixel *p*  plus a threshold value *t* or all blow the intensity of *p-t*. than *p* is classified as corner.

* Without the improvement of *machine learning*, N is usually chosen as 12. In OpenCV, other type of FAST are available.

**Steps of the algorithm**

If N is 12, then the algorithm is as follows:
1. Examining pixels 1 and 9,if both are within*[Ip-t,Ip+t]* ,then candidate is not a corner
2. Otherwise pixels 5 and 13 are examined. if there exists 3 of them that are either brighter or darker, then rest pixels are then examined for final conclusion

## **SURF**
------------
**Detector**

* SURF uses square-shaped filters as an approximation of Gaussian smoothing. SURF uses a _blob detector_ based on the **Hessian matrix** to find points of interest. 
* The _determinant_ of the Hessian matrix is used as a measure of local change around the point and points are chosen where the determinant is maximal.
* SURF also uses the determinant of the Hessian for selecting the scale.
* The box filter of size 9x9 is an approximation of a Gaussian with \sigma=1.2 and represents the lowest level(highest spatial resolution) for blob-response maps.

**Scale-space representation an location of points of interest**

* The scale space is divided into a number of octaves, where an octave refers to a series of reponse maps of covering a doubling of scale. The following layers are obtained by filtering the image with **gradually bigger masks**, taking into account the discrete nature of integral images and the specific filter structure.

**Descriptor**

* The  first step consists of fixing a reproducible orientation based on information from a **circular region around the interest point**. 
 * Then we construct a **square region aligned to the selected orientation**, and extract the SURF descriptor from it.

**Orientation assignmen**

* The Haar wavelet responses in both x- and y-directions within a circular neighbourhood of radius *6s* around the point of interest are computed, where _s_ is the scale at which the point of interest was detected.
* The obtained responses are weighted by a Gaussian function centered at the point of interest, then plotted as points in a two-dimensional space, with the horizontal response in the abscissa and the vertical response in the ordinate
* The dominant orientation is estimated by calculating the sum of all responses within a sliding orientation window of size Ï€/3. The horizontal and vertical responses within the window are summed.
* The two summed responses then yield a local orientation vector. The longest such vector overall defines the orientation of the point of interest. The size of the sliding window is a parameter that has to be chosen carefully to achieve a desired balance between robustness and angular resolution.

## **ORB**
---------
**FAST** keypoint detector and **BRIEF** descriptor

**Algorithm**

* a _Harris corner measure_ to order the **FAST** keypoints
For a target number _N_ of keypoints, we first set the threshold low enough to get more than _N_ keypoints, then order them according to the Harris measure, and pick the top _N_ points
* FAST doesnt' produce multi-scale features.
We employ a scale pryamid of the image,and produce FAST features(filtered by Harris) at each level in the pyramid.
* High variance makes a feature more discriminative, since it responds differentially to inputs.

**Detector**(_oFAST:FAST Keypoint Orientation_)

* a _Harris corner measure_ to order the **FAST** keypoints
* Orientation by _Intensity Centroid_

**Descriptor**(_rBRIEF:Rotation-Aware BRIEF_)

> Steered BRIEF: 
>>in-plane rotation invariant
>>steer BRIEF according to the orientation of keypoints

> Variance and Correlation
>>High variance makes a feature more discriminative
>>Uncorrelated means more new information

> learning Good Binary Featuress to get **rBRIEF**
>> **Aim**: To recover from the loss of variance in steered BRIEF,and to reduce correlation among the binary tests.
>>Run each test against all training patches
>>Order the tests by their distance from a mean of 0.5, forming the vector T.
>>Greedy search

**Scalable Matching of Binary Features**
> We choose Locality Sensitive Hashing as our nearest neighbor search

## **SIFT**
---------
* detector and descriptor
* This approach transforms an image into a large collection of local feature vectors,each of which is invariant to image translation, scaling, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection.

### Tips
* The scale-invariant features are efficiently identified by using a staged filtering approach.
* Partial invariance to local variations, such as affine or 3D projections, by blurring image gradient locations.

### Detector
1. Use the Gaussian kernel and its derivations to build an image pyramid.
2. Select key locations at maxima and minima of a difference of Gaussian function applied in scale space.

### Descriptor
1. Compute the image gradient magnitude and orientation at each pxel at each level
2. Each key location is assigned a canonical orientation which is determined by the peak in a histogram of local image gradient orientations.

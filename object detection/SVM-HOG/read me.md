OBJECT DETECTION
--------------
This file is about object detection using **SVM** and **HOG** method.
I use HOG features to train a new SVM detector and then I use this detector in some pictures.
The results are in file testedImg.

* There are not enough number of samples, so the performance is not well.  
* Is there something wrong in the code of objectDetection.cpp ?

thanks~
